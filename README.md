Nothing special about this bot. It posts a new image on Bluesky once (used to be twice) a day. Feel free to use it. Don't abuse my image repo :)
The code was meticulously made by ChatGPT, based on Bluesky guidelines and one similar C# project, but converterd to Python - because it's the only programming lanugage I am at least familiar with.
Couldn't be bothered to hide the images in a private folder, but it can easily be done.
Just need to remember to upload new images once in a while, otherwise it runs perfectly as a GitHub Action.
Make sure images are all smaller than 1 MB (there is some kind of limit on Bluesky).
UPDATE: 1 Nov 2025 - pinned to Python 3.11 for compatibility because GitHub Actions changed their default to 3.14, which is not supported ny atproto (Bluesky protocol).
